# Sbopkg queuefile for openbox, plus a few extas.
# Tested on Slackware 12.2
# Created by Chess Griffin
#
# This is a queue file for openbox, plus several extras that are
# helpful or commonly used with openbox.  They are all optional and
# not required dependencies of openbox.  If giblib, and feh are
# desired, remove the '-' in front of their names.  Or, turn them on
# in the sbopkg dialog menus.  Obconf must be compiled after openbox.
