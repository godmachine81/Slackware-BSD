README-renames

Packages which are renamed in a repository are handled by adding them to
a file whose name ends in '.renames' which is stored in the
/etc/sbopkg/renames.d directory.

Renames are written, one per line, in the following format:

    oldname=newname

The default file that is installed with sbopkg is '50-default.renames'.
This file is kept in sync with the SBo repository and will be
overwritten each time sbopkg is upgraded, so do not make local edits to
it. Instead, create other files with a higher or lower number than 50
and list your renamed files in those local files.

The files are loaded in alphabetical order (like the files in, e.g.,
/etc/fonts/conf.d) so 'priority' is determined from low number to high
and the first match wins, so:

    $ cat /etc/sbopkg/renames.d/10-local.renames
    foo=bar

will override anything in a higher-numbered file, including anything in
50-default.renames, such as:

    $ cat /etc/sbopkg/renames.d/50-default
    foo=baz
